Our shared Unified Driving Engine (UDE) can support both text-driven and audio-driven human motion generation. Left shows an example of a motion sequence driven by a text description while Right shows an example driven by a LA Hiphop music clip 

# Abstract
#### Generating controllable and editable human motion sequences is a key challenge in 3D Avatar generation. It has been labor-intensive to generate and animate human motion for a long time until learning-based approaches have been developed and applied recently. However, these approaches are still task-specific or modality-specific. In this paper, we propose ‚ÄúUDE‚Äù, the first unified driving engine that enables generating human motion sequences from natural language or audio sequences. Specifically, UDE consists of the following key components: 1) a motion quantization module based on VQVAE that represents continuous motion sequence as discrete latent code, 2) a modality-agnostic transformer encoder that learns to map modality-aware driving signals to a joint space, and 3) a unified token transformer (GPT-like) network to predict the quantized latent code index in an auto-regressive manner. 4) a diffusion motion decoder that takes as input the motion tokens and decodes them into motion sequences with high diversity. We evaluate our method on HumanML3D and AIST++ benchmarks, and the experiment results demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance

# Overview
#### Our model consists of four key components. First, we train a codebook using VQ-VAE. For the codebook, each code represents a certain pattern of the motion sequence. Second, we introduce a ModalityAgnostic Transformer Encoder (MATE). It takes the input of different modalities and transforms them into sequential embedding in one joint space. The third component is a Unified Token Transformer (UTT). We feed it with sequential embedding obtained by MATE and predict the motion token sequences in an auto-regressive manner. The fourth component is a Diffusion Motion Decoder (DMD). Unlike recent works, which are modality-specific, our DMD is modality-agnostic. Given the motion token sequences, DMD encodes them to semantic-rich embedding and then decodes them to motion sequences in continuous space by the reversed diffusion process.


# Demo

#### We show a short demo video on how our model can generate motion sequence with mixed modality of inputs. To watch full demo video, please visit this site: (https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaG1PTvzkxA)

# Getting started

This code was tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and requires:
* Python 3.8
* Conda
* CUDA capable GPU (single GPU works!)


### 1. Setup enviroment

Clone this repo and move it to: 

    git clone https://github.com/zixiangzhou916/UDE.git
    cd UDE

Create a conda enviroment, activate it, and install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2. Pretrained model downloading

The pretrained checkpoints could be downloaded from [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13aLxNhgEOwxIkdT-taH7Ig-4j4ObJAaB?usp=sharing). 

    tar -xzvf checkpoints.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf smpl_models.tar.gz

The unzipped checkpoint files will be organized as:
    
    checkpoints
    |--- ude_best.pth
    |--- dmd_best.pth
    |--- vqvae_best.pth
    |--- ViT-B-32.pt

Unzip the files and put move the smpl_models:

    mv smpl networks

The smpl models should be organized as:

    |networks
    |--- smpl
        |--- J_regressor_extra.npy
        |--- kintree_table.pkl
        |--- SMPL_FEMALE.pkl
        |--- SMPL_MALE.pkl
        |--- SMPL_NEUTRAL.pkl

### 3. Run the demo

We provide sample data for quick demo, the sample data are organized as:

    |sample_data
    |--- t2m
        |--- text_descriptions.json
    |--- a2m
        |--- gHO_sBM_cAll_d21_mHO5_ch01.npy
        |--- 

Run the following command to play with it:

    sh demo.sh

### 4. Train your own UDE

    Comming soon

### 5. Evaluate the model

    Comming soon
